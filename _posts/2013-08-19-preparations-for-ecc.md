As part of our preparations for the upcoming European Curling Championships in October we started practice sessions with coach Andreas Unterberger (who will be going to ECC in Denmark with us). Today we had the first of three theory sessions and after that we can look forward to a weekend of being on the ice again - for the first time after the off-season break.

Tip of the day: know thy openings (and be on the same page about it with the whole team).
