As mentioned in the previous post, today we start our preparation tournament in Bratislava ([EECC](http://eecc2013.wordpress.com/)).

We are also taking this opportunity to test our system for showing live scores of games as they progress (which we will try to use at the European championship).

Our first game of the tournament will be against Croatia:

<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>

<div id="liveScore"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var gameCode = 'H9qOD9mn';
</script>
