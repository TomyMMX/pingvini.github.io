As mentioned in the previous post, we are participating in an international tournament in Bratislava this weekend ([EECC](http://eecc2013.wordpress.com/)).

We will also take this opportunity to test our live score system (which we will try to use at the European championships).

Our first game of the tournament will be against Croatia, the next against Hungary, and after that Slovenia's position in the group will determine how we continue.

Slovenia finished 3rd in the group (although we were very close to finishing 1st). Thus our last opponents will be Romania:

Update: Except for the first game, our live scores were not exactly live, due to the lack of score reporting manpower. We hope this will be easier at the ECC, where we will have an alternate with us.
