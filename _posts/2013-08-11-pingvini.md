We are looking for meaning behind the cryptic name *Pingvini*.

As some of you know, the team has used at least two names before. What was the motivation for this latest sobriquet? Does it have a deeper meaning or is it really as superficial as "Err... things on ice... penguins?".

Some have tried to connect the name to:

* [team penguins](http://penguins.nhl.com),
  [team penguins](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=penguins+of+madagascar)
* the mysterious symbol <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pic/al-logo.png" alt="???" height="32px">
* the phrase "ustanovljen pod Å marno goro" (maybe this should be under the 1st bullet)
* ... and much much more

Word of the day: *apophenia*

A challenge for our followers - while you may never know the true answer, you can still help us come up with a good [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym). The winner gets a free beer so put your thinking caps on!

**Update**: after receiving several good suggestions, we decided the following submission from an anonymous reader deserves to win. If nothing else, he/she learned the word of the day! Unfortunately (for him/her) we will have to drink the beer ourselves - drawbacks of anonimity.

> Nonsensical
