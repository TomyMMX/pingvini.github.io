This weekend we were in Kitzb√ºhel - on the ice for the first time this season.

The first slides were not very elegant, but we soon got the feeling back. A month before the European championships we wanted to avoid major changes to our deliveries. The focus was instead on smaller improvements to our technique for which we received some very useful tips from our coach.

We also played a friendly match against the [Austrian national junior team](https://www.facebook.com/curlingteamaustria). We were missing our third so we borrowed Tomas from our friends and rivals [Bojsi](https://www.facebook.com/curlingbojsi). And our coach Andreas Unterberger substituted for the missing lead on the Austrian team.  
After a poor start (we were happy to concede a steal of *only* two) we started to play better. We managed to tie in the 6th, but failed to prevent a deuce in the 7th and ran out of rocks in the end. 
Despite the loss we enjoyed the game and were quite satisfied with our performance. The Austrian team deserved the win, but we were not without chances.
